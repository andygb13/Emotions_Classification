To use this program, run the following commands:
1. `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create conda environment
2. `conda activate myenv` to activate environment created in the previous step
3. `python video_emotions.py` to run script

There are sample input and output files located in the `./video_in` and `./video_out` directories. To use a custom file, adjust the `VIDEO_NAME` variable in the Python script (without the file extention) as required.
